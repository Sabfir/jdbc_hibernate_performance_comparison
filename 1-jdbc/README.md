Jeff Friesen - Java Threads and the Concurrency Utilities (The Expert's Voice in Java) - 2015

## Chapter 1. Threads and Runnables
Write an IntSleep application that creates a background thread
to repeatedly output Hello and then sleep for 100 milliseconds.
After sleeping for 2 seconds, the default main thread should
interrupt the background thread, which should break out of the
loop after outputting interrupted .
